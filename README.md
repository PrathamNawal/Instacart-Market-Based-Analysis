# Instacart-Market-Based-Analysis
nstacart’s data science team plays a big part in providing this delightful shopping experience. Currently they use transactional data to develop models that predict which products a user will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session. In this competition, Instacart is challenging the Kaggle community to use this anonymized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order.
